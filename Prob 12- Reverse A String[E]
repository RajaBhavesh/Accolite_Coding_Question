//Question Link-> https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-string/1

//Method 1-> 
//using two pointer approach 
//The idea is to use two pointers. The left pointer is placed at the beginning of the string and the right pointer is placed at the end of the string.
//Now swap the characters at left and right pointers,
//after that left pointer moves forward by 1 step and right pointer moves backward by 1 step. This operation is continued till right pointer is ahead of left pointer.
//Time Complexity-> O(N)
//Space Complexity-> O(1)

//C++ Code->
string reverseStr(string& str)
{
    int n = str.length();
 
    // Swap character starting from two
    // corners
    // i is the left pointer and j is the right pointer
    for (int i = 0, j = n - 1; i < j; i++, j--)
        swap(str[i], str[j]);
    return str;
}



//Method 2-> using inbuilt functions
//Time Complexity-> O(N)
//Space Complexity-> O(1)

//C++ Code->

string reverseStr(string& str)
{
    reverse(str.begin(),str.end());
    return str;
}


//Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
